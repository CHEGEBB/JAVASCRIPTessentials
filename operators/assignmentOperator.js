//The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.
//The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
//example
let city = "London";
let number = 7;
//if multiple assignments appear iin a sequence the right to left ordr is respected
let year =2023;
// let newYear = year = 2024;//commented this as let does not let us reassign a variable
///this is the same as
year = 2024;
let newYear = year;
//thats all for the assignment operator
