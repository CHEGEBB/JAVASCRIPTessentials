/*What is fetch?
fetch is a modern JavaScript API used to make network requests (like GET, POST, etc.) to a server and retrieve data.
It's promise-based, meaning it returns a Promise that resolves when the request is complete.*/
/*
Making a GET Request

A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server.
fetch(url) initiates a request to the specified URL and returns a Promise.
Handling the Response

The response object contains the data from the server.
Use .json() to parse JSON data from the response.
Catching Errors

Handle errors using .catch() to ensure your app doesn't crash
