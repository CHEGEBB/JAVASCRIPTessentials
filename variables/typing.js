//javascript is a weakly or dynamically typed language, this means that you do not have to declare the type of a variable when you declare it, the type of the variable is determined by the value that is assigned to it
let greeting = "Goodmorning";
greeting = 5;
let age = 20;
console.log(greeting);
//e.g you cant say like in c 
//int age = 20;
//instead you can just say
//let age = 20;
